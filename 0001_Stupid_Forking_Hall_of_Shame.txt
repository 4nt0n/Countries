Stupid Forking and HALL OF SHAME

HALL OF SHAME No. 1:

iptvmate - This idiot is especially thirsty! He was warned by me!

He copies the complete M3Us from me without permission, he doesn't even change the file names. 
The M3U's are a 1: 1 copy of my files as of the status (date) in the respective articles:

https://iptvmate.net/germany-iptv-channels-playlists/

https://iptvmate.net/united-states-iptv-channels-playlists/

https://iptvmate.net/brazil-iptv-channels-playlists/

and so on, he is unable to create something himself, he steals it and then offers it as something of his own on his homepage!

HALL OF SHAME No. 2:

Maggy - The user was warned publicly by me and other!

Until recently he used many of my M3U's without my permission to then offer them as something of his own in this forum!

Not only I, others such as Apsat have already warned him!

What this insolent user in the vuplus forum did not know before, i have an account in the forum! I downloaded the files adapted
for VU +, except for the iptv_xumo.rar, copied everything from my repo without asking me!

There are also other postings with M3Us that he has abused for his  profiling in the forum, but he does not deserve any further
attention!

HALL OF SHAME No. 3?

EVERYONE I catch copying my M3Us without my permission, distributing them on the Internet or misusing them 
for the purposes of their own profiling will end up here on this page! Also here within Github there are 2 specialists
who have a keen eye on!

STUPID FORKING

What annoys not only me but also others is the stupid creation of a fork!

You can read here what also annoys others about the forks

At the moment there are 56 forks from my repo. Again, most of them were just created stupidly as without using the sense of a fork.

At the moment there are 56 forks from my repo. Again, most of them were just created stupidly as without using the sense of a fork.

Anyone who creates a fork of my repo and does NOT have the status Contributor after a few days will be blocked from now on!

There are a few specialists at Github who have nothing of their own, only have forks and are not the forks contributors to any.

Only these users are contributors: 

https://github.com/Free-IPTV/Countries/graphs/contributors

Only 3 users  (not contributor) have at least participated via issues. With the other forks, where nothing happens.

I'm really tired of this stupid forking, from now on it will be blocked. I'll block these 43 users shortly, it's annoying!
