Free legally receivable IPTV channels as .m3u for Kodi. :-)

The lists work fine with me in the IPTV Simple Client from Kodi. To automatically create the individual lists
to one list, i use the ADD-On IPTV-Merge from Matt Huisman. ;-) Without Kodi you can use the lists in the VLC-Media Player. :-)

You can also use the ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u, there you have all TV stations in one list (.m3u).

The correct link to use the Playlist-ALL in the VLC-Player or with the IPTV Simple Client in Kodi is:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Free-IPTV/Countries/master/ZZ_PLAYLIST_ALL_TV.m3u

Or use the following shortlink:

https://is.gd/freeiptvall

Important! Some streams (very few) only work in Kodi with the Youtube add-on ;-)

Should a channel stop working, just leave a message. You can this with the Menu "Issues". :-)
