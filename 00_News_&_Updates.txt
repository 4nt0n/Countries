Free-IPTV - Only legal streams are the way to go :-)

To make it easier for you, you will find the daily updates and information about my project here from today- :-)

Some really bad guys have been really pissing me off lately so my repo wasn't available, sorry for that. I will of course continue!

If you like my M3U's, I am very happy about a small donation, you can find it in the readme below in my repository
